## Install

Add `@helia/css` to your project via npm:

```sh
npm install @helia/css
```

## Usage

Once you've installed `@helia/css` from npm, the CSS and SCSS files and the web-fonts are available from your `node_modules/@helia/css` directory.

If you are set up with a build process that lets you import css files directly from `node_modules`, then you can just add the following to your CSS file.

```css
@import 'tachyons'; /* Optional, jolly good tho */
@import '@helia/css';
```

The file includes font-face definitions and single purpose CSS class names that you can compose freely, to create your lovely UI.

```html
<header class='pa2 bg-navy'>
  <h2 class='ma0 montserrat aqua'>
    OH HAI! It's so nice to see you again.
  </h2>
</header>
```

### CSS in JS

You can import the `theme.json` file which can be used with a [ThemeProvider] component.

All **the CSS atoms are generated** from that, so you can be sure you're using the same values.

### Less

`helia.css` is a regular CSS file, so you can import it normally. Each declaration has a single purpose, so if you prefer to compose your rules outside the DOM, you can safely use them as mixins:

```less
.my-lovely-widget {
  .aqua;
  .bg-navy;
  .montserrat;
}
```

### SCSS

While `helia.css` contains everything you need, if you prefer variables for fonts, colors and gradients, these are there for you in `theme.scss`.
